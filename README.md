SlimCalcPy is an open source calculator, made to stand up to the power and functionality of top notch calculators on the market.
It's goal is to bring a free useful calculator to everyone, so no one is at a disadvantage because of their monetary standing.
Simply type in full expressions even with parentheses and exponents, and it will return the appropriate result.
Developments are being done to allow it to do computer algebra and calculus. Check out the calculus module to view the many functions already available (e.g. minima and maxima, derivatives at a point, finding all critical points).
We hope this will help support social equality and equal opportunity.

The calculator is designed to be a class in the OOP sense, with purely functional internal workings.
The program cascades down through the input equation, refining it further with each pass until it is all simplified.
This calculator adheres to the order of operations, and will soon allow for major functions such as the logarithms and the trigonometric functions.
Despite the ease it would provide, this calculator has no dependencies, and operates without even built in libraries.
